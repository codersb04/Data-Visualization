## Data Visualization_01
Done visualization on Telecom Churn data
Types cover here are:
1. Quatitative Feature:
   - Histogram and density plot
   - Density plot or Kernel Density plots
   - distplot
   - boxplot
   - Violin plot
2. Categorical and Binary features
   - Frequency table
   - Bar Plot
3. Multivariate Visualization
   - Quatitative vs Quantitative features: Joint plot, Scatter Plot
   - Quantitative vs Categorical Features: lmplot, Box Plot, Catplot
   - Categorical vs Categorical: Count plot
4. Contigeny table
   - Cross Tabulation or cross tab
5. t-SNE
   - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. Its basic idea is simple: find a projection for a high-dimensional feature space onto a plane (or a 3D hyperplane, but it is almost always 2D) such that those points that were far apart in the initial n-dimensional space will end up far apart on the plane. Those that were originally close would remain close to each other.
Essentially, neighbor embedding is a search for a new and less-dimensional data representation that preserves neighborship of examples.</br></br></br>
